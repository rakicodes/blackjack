# How It's Made
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

This was built using the [Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). I took advantage of the methods already built in the API to create the deck, shuffle the cards, display the cards and to draw a card. The game logic is implemented all inside a constructor function. There I created functions to deal, stand, drawCard, and many more to simulate an in-person blackjack game.

# Lessons Learned
I learned how to use setTimeOut() to show the game status 2 seconds after the player wins, draws, or loses against the dealer to give time to the player to see their cards.
